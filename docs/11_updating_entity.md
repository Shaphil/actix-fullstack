## Updating the entity

Now that we have the `password` field in our migration and in our database, we need to update our `entity` to reflect
that change.

This is pretty simple. We simply rerun the entity creation command again.

```bash
sea-orm-cli generate entity -o entity/src
```

We are simply regenerating the entity. Since we already have an entity from before, and we only added the migration for
the `password` field, the regenerated entity remains unchanged except the newly added field. If you were using Git, you
would see only the `password` field in the diff.

Here's the regenerated entity,

```rust
//! `SeaORM` Entity, @generated by sea-orm-codegen 1.0.0

use sea_orm::entity::prelude::*;
use serde::Serialize;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, DeriveEntityModel, Eq, Serialize)]
#[sea_orm(table_name = "user")]
pub struct Model {
    #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
    pub id: i32,
    #[sea_orm(unique)]
    pub username: String,
    pub firstname: Option<String>,
    pub lastname: Option<String>,
    #[sea_orm(unique)]
    pub email: String,
    pub password: String,   // new, just added
    pub is_active: Option<bool>,
    pub last_login: Option<DateTime>,
    pub date_joined: Option<DateTime>,
    pub created_at: Option<DateTime>,
    pub updated_at: Option<DateTime>,
}

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveRelation)]
pub enum Relation {}

impl ActiveModelBehavior for ActiveModel {}
```
